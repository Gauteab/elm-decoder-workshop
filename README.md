# elm-decoder-workshop

## Getting started

* Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
* Open one of the files in the `/src` directory.
* Each task has its own npm-script which is found in the comment above the task (eg. `npm run person`). Complete the
  task by implementing a working decoder (replacing `Decode.fail "TODO: Decoder not yet implemented"`).
* Your code will be tested on every save. Once the tests have passed, quit the task (`CTRL + C`) and move on to the 
  next one.
